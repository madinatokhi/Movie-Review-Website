                    <img src="NUN.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="Movie 1 Poster"><br>
                    <p>In 1952 Romania, two nuns living at the Saint Cartha's monastery are attacked by an unseen evil force. The surviving nun, Sister Victoria, flees from the attacker, a demon appearing as a nun, and hangs herself. Her body is discovered by Frenchie, a villager who transports supplies to the nuns.<br>
                        teenagers, because it certainly isn't for mature audiences. “The Nun II” follows Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) five years after the first film's events. When she befriends Debra (Storm Reid), a newbie nun in a crisis of faith, they are put to the test after the Vatican demands Irene perform another miracle. Valak was not destroyed, and she’s reigning terror on religious figures across Europe. As priests fall victim to gruesome demonic murders, from immolations to hangings and more, Irene and Debra rush to a French boarding school to figure out Valak’s motive and how to send her back to hell. </p>

                    <img src="True%20Detective.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="Movie 3 Poster">
                    <p> "True Detective" is not a movie but a critically acclaimed television series. Each season of "True Detective" tells a self-contained story with different characters and plotlines. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, "True Detective" has three seasons. However, please note that there may have been additional seasons or developments beyond that timeframe.</p>

                    <p> Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is one of the best action packed anime films this year. As this is a prequel to the title anime series, some characters we see here we are not familiar with but the emotional weight and foundations to well with this engaging narrative!
                        An emotionally charged, complex story that expands the series'Jujutsu Kaisen is starkly modern in its setting, tone, and how it looks unflinchingly at both the good and bad of 21st century humanity. The magic that powers the show’s characters is called “Cursed Energy,” a version of ki born of negative emotions such as shame, hatred, fear, and grief. The show’s Cursed Spirits aren’t ghosts, but accumulations of intense negative feelings that humans create. As a byproduct of humanity, they are stronger and more common in metropolitan areas; highly populated environments brimming with human feelings.</p>
